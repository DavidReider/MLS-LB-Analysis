# MLS-LB-Analysis
Comparing MLS left-backs with 2018-19 data imported from a CSV file retrieved from Instat.

Practice using Python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn.
The program imports the CSV file and plots all left backs that have >1000 minutes played according to their statistics.

It also selects just players who play for the team Philadelphia Union and plots them in a different color to see how they compare to the league and themselves.
